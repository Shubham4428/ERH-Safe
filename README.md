This code is an Angular application that appears to be a part of a health records management system. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Sidebar: The sidebar contains navigation links for different sections, such as "Health Records," "Prescription," and "Investigation."
Header: The header displays the title "Health Records."
Filter Section:Allows users to filter health records.Includes a search input field.
Patient Search Section:Users can search for patients by name using an input field.
Patient names are displayed as buttons, and clicking a button triggers an action (likely to show detailed health records).
Health Record Display Section:Displays health records for the selected patient.
Uses a grid layout to present records with information such as symptoms, date, updated by, and description.
Implements pagination controls for navigating through the records.
Pagination:Enables users to navigate through different pages of health records.


The application uses various styling elements, including colors, borders, and shadows, to enhance the visual appeal.
Overall, this code represents a front-end interface for managing and viewing health records. It incorporates Angular for dynamic rendering and user interaction, along with Angular Material components for a consistent and visually appealing design. The application allows users to search for patients, view their health records, and navigate through paginated results.
